As transfers, we only experience UCLA for 2 or 3 years. We have to make the most of our time here. It is tremendously helpful to be surrounded by a group of students who share a similar experience—that is the service that Chi Alpha Psi provides. The fraternity serves as a social and academic foundation, from which transfers can venture forth into the rest of what UCLA has to offer. We provide more than just resources, we provide family. Every brother and sister of Chi Alpha Psi is involved in various activities and other organizations on and off campus. We all get to benefit from each member's unique experience.?"
